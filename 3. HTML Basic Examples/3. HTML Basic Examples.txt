3. HTML Basic Examples

In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.
Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.

HTML Documents:

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration:

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
