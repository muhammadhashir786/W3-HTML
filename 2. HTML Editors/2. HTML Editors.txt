2. HTML Editors:

A simple text editor is all you need to learn HTML.

we use "Notepad" to learn HTML as a beginner in Windows 10.
But Professional websites have been created and modified by using professional Code Editors.

Step 1: Open Notepad (PC)
Step 2: Write Some HTML Code

Code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

Step 3: Save the HTML Page

Extension of HTML:

There are 2 extensions of HTML file:

.htm
.html

we can save the HTML file using ".htm" or ".html" extensions.
There is no difference; it is up to you.
But it is recommended to use ".html" file extension.

Step 4: View the HTML File/Output in Your Browser
